## Kafka Integration

Kafka Integration â€” is an open-source distributed software message broker under the Apache foundation. It is written in the Java and Scala programming languages.

Designed as a distributed, horizontally scalable system that provides capacity growth both with an increase in the number and load from the sources, and the number of subscriber systems. Subscribers can be combined into groups. Supports the ability to temporarily store data for subsequent batch processing.

In some scenarios, Kafka can be used instead of a message queue, in cases where there is no stable connection between the device and ThingsBoard.
